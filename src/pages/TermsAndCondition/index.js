            5.1. Your entry into the Draw will be immediately upon our
            acceptance of your entry. You will be then entered into the
            applicable Draw.

          <h3 className="heading my-4">How the Draw works</h3>

          <p className="textContent my-4">
            5.2. Our Draw works in a tiered way. Your entry (whether paid route
            or free entry) will be placed into the Draw and on the 1st day from
            the start date, the Website algorithm will automatically remove half
            of the entries elected at random, leaving the other half remaining
            in the Draw.
          </p>

          <p className="textContent my-4">
            5.3. The remaining entrants will then be given the opportunity to be
            bought out which is only effective if all entrants elect to take
            this option (“Buyout Option”).
          </p>

          <p className="textContent my-4">
            5.4. If the Buyout Option is not elected by all remaining entrants
            and the Draw continues towards the closing date, the Draw will
            continue to delete half the entries at random each day, offering the
            same Buyout Option at each stage. This tiered process continues
            until the closing date for the Draw and the last entry is deemed the
            winner of the Draw (“Winner”).
          </p>

          <p className="textContent my-4">
            5.5. On each occasion that the Draw reduces, a Buyout Option is
            offered to the remaining entrants which will only be payable if all
            remaining entrants elect that route.
          </p>

          <p className="textContent my-4">
            5.6. During the periods of ticket reductions referred to in clauses
            5.2 to 5.5, entrants will have access to an online marketplace on
            the Website (“Marketplace”). Members and entrants who have tickets
            remaining and are still active in the Draw will have the option to
            sell their current entry(ies) in the Draw to another entrant in the
            Draw. These users can be any existing Member and do not have to have
            been involved in the initial purchasing of the original entry. The
            tickets will be allowed to be sold in the Marketplace until the day
            before the Closing Date and until a Winner is chosen. Members with
            free tickets will also have access to this marketplace and they will
